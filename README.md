# üìö Algorithm Problems and Solutions  
A collection of fundamental algorithm problems and my solutions in **Python** using Jupyter Notebooks. üöÄüêç  

## Problem Categories  

| Category            | Description |
|---------------------|------------|
| **Backtracking**    | Solving problems by exploring all possibilities recursively. | 
| **Dynamic Programming** | Breaking problems into smaller subproblems and solving them efficiently. 
| **Stack & Queue**   | Using LIFO (Stack) or FIFO (Queue) for problem-solving. |
| **Priority Queue**  | Implementing efficient priority-based data structures. | 
| **Linked List**     | Working with singly and doubly linked lists. | 
| **Binary Tree**     | Solving problems involving tree traversal, search, and modifications. | 
| **Graph**          | Algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and more. |
